-- üîç PHASE 2.3 Referential Integrity Validation Checks
-- =====================================================
-- Purpose: Ensure that Every entry in the different table has a corresponding entry in their refereced tables.
-- These checks confirm that no orphaned references exist and that the database upholds ACID-compliant design principles.
